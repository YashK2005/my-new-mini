# ShoPacks - A Shopify Mini App

ShoPacks is a gamified shopping experience that combines the thrill of collecting trading cards with Shopify products. Think Pokémon Trading Card Game meets e-commerce!

In an era where collecting Pokémon cards is making a massive comeback and Pokémon cards are reaching record popularity, ShoPacks transforms everyday shopping into an engaging collecting experience. We're solving the challenge of passive product browsing by giving users a compelling reason to discover and engage with products - building their digital collection while they shop. This not only drives brand awareness and product discovery but creates a vibrant community of collectors who share, trade, and showcase their unique product card collections.
